Template.create(title: "My Dearest", content: "I used to dream of a quiet place
  in the trees, a place where the sun barely broke through. There was gentle water
  and still branches, and cool air that quenced a thirst I did not know I had. But
  you, my love, have rendered this dream obsolete. You are perfectly yourself,
  as natural as the stream in your grace. I listen to your breath like
  the air in the forest, and it is the music in my heart. You have become something
  more than any dream could be. You are natural and everlasting. You are my quiet
  place.", category: c1)

Template.create(title: "Villain", content: "I have heard of your actions, you
  scullion. You are the best of cutthroats, and I should have known you had it in
  you. I remember well my first impression of you: a most notable coward. Had I not
  been convinced of your integrity by our mutual acquantaince, I could have saved
  myself the trouble of your friendship. I know better now, and I will not make
  the mistake again of granting you such favor. May we be better strangers in the
  future.", category: c3)

Template.create(title: "Stardust", content: "I can hardly believe that I am made of
  starstuff. I know so little about this world or any of the worlds beyond it. I
  am ignorant of how I could be so complex when the things I say and feel are so
  simple. Yet, it makes sense that you are celestial--you who knows so much,
  who stays awake at night with your family in the stars. Your mind is as expansive
  as the night sky, and you are as much a part of it as any other star. You are
  truly stardust, and you are making me believe that I am too.", category: c1)

Template.create(title: "Yeah...No", content: "We're breaking up. This must come
  as a surprise to you, given how difficult it is for you to hear voices
  that are not your own. Had you been listening, you would have heard me try to
  end things last week, but you were distracted by your reflection in the cafe window.
  I understand. However briefly, I too was distracted by your face. I had hoped
  it could make up for all the things you said and did, but in fact, no amount of
  please symmetry could make you tolerable. I hope that you can read better than
  you can listen. We're over.", category: c2)
